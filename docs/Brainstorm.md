Elevator Pitch:
World Plot or Theme (DEFAULT):

In the world of <code360>, you play the role of a Catalyst.  Things have gone to shit!  A vicious virus has ravaged the entire world.  Official estimate that as much as 1% have been infected.  Thousands dead. People are changing, the world is more devided than ever.  Prepping for the apocolypse is probably a good idea.  No not the Xmen blue guy, the fire and brimstone, hell on earth.  While officials at the CDC say, that a cure is around the corner, panic grows.  


Virus: C360-206  - CDC Officals report that the virus originated simpultaneaously in several locations thoughtout the world, leaving experts to speculate that the virus was man-made!

Virus carriers...
Most of the people with the virus are mere carriers and may not show signs or ever develop the disease in it's full form.
